# Contract Management — Frontend (Vite + React)

This is a minimal single-page frontend for the Contract Management project. It includes a Service Request submission form that you'll later connect to the backend and deploy to Vercel.

Quick start:

1. cd into the frontend folder

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

When you're ready, provide the Vercel project link and I will connect this repo/deployment and adjust build/settings if needed.
